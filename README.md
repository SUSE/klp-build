# Creating a livepatch for multiple SUSE Linux Enterprise codestreams

## Configuration
klp-build supports a per-user configuration file located in
__~/.config/klp-build/config__, following the standard ``key=value`` format.
The mandatory variables are:

#### work_dir
Path to directory where the livepatch data/code will be placed, including the one
generated by the different stages of the livepatch creation.
By default set to: __~/klp/livepatches__.

#### data_dir
Path to directory where the dowloaded kernels source code will be placed. To create a
livepatch for upstream kernel, it has to point to a kernel tree with the
sources already built. By default set to: __~/klp/data__.
Option ``--data-dir``, if set, will overwrite the path specified here.

#### kernel_src_dir
Only used for SLE kernels. Should contain the path to the
[kernel-source tree](https://github.com/SUSE/kernel-source) in order to check
which codestreams already contains the fix and don't need the livepatch. It also
gets the fix for the CVE being livepatched.

## Setup
To create a new "livepatch project", use the setup command:

```sh
klp-build setup --name bsc1197597 --cve 2022-1048 --mod snd-pcm --conf CONFIG_SND_PCM --file-funcs sound/core/pcm.c snd_pcm_attach_substream snd_pcm_detach_substream --codestreams '15.5' --archs x86_64 ppc64le
```

klp-build will check if the configuration is enabled, if the symbol is present
on the module being livepatched. The check will be done in all architectures
informed as argument. If the argument is not informed, it will return an error
if configuration is not available on any of them.

## Extraction

[klp-ccp](https://github.com/SUSE/klp-ccp) is used to extract the defective functions.
To extract the livepatches, run the command below:

```sh
klp-build extract --name bsc1197597
```

The resulting livepatched will be placed
on __~/klp/livepatches/bsc1197597/ccp/$codestream__/lp, for example:

``/home/john/klp/livepatches/bsc1197597/ccp/15.5u40/lp``
